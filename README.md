# Customer Churn Prediction System
This project aims to predict which customers are likely to leave a subscription service. It uses customer data to support retention strategies, it was developed as the final assignment for the Machine Learning course under Dr. Nermeen Hamza at the Faculty of Graduate Studies for Statistical Researches (FGSSR) – Cairo University.

## **Objective**

To build a predictive system that helps businesses identify customers likely to churn (leave the service) and provide intelligent retention strategies using machine learning.

## **Project Pipeline**

   - Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling (RobustScaler, MinMaxScaler)
   - Feature Selection: Based on correlation and model relevance
   - Imbalance Handling: SMOTE oversampling used for training
   - Models Trained:
       - Logistic Regression
       - XGBoost
       - LightGBM
       - Stacking Classifier
   - Evaluation: Compared models using Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Deployment:
       - Deployed via Gradio
       - Integrated with LLM-powered module for personalized retention offers 

## **Deployment**

You can try the system live via Gradio (link provided in notebook or deployment instructions).
